# Expo and npm Installation and Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through installing npm (Node Package Manager), Expo CLI, and running an Expo project.

## Installing Node.js and npm

npm comes bundled with Node.js, so we'll install Node.js first.

1. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.

To verify the installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Both commands should return version numbers if the installation was successful.

# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
